Hi, my name is Jamie. I'm a Cornwall-based developer/designer who loves building software but just can't shake off the fun of designing either.

I started all this as a Graphic Designer - qualifying with a BA(Hons) from University College Falmouth in 2011. 

Since then, I've progressively moved towards a more technical role. These days I'm most happy building web applications and sites using a variety of technologies and frameworks, but particularly enjoy API development and designing application and database architectures.

I've been freelancing since 2013, but have recently been working for Bikesoup as their Lead Developer. In that time I've initiated and completed a ground-up rebuild of all their websites and supporting tools.

I believe there's great value and beauty in simple, elegant solutions. I get a great deal of satisfaction building durable, flexible software that lasts and will be an asset to a business for years to come.

To get in touch about working with me, please [send me an email](mailto:jamiedumont@icloud.com).
