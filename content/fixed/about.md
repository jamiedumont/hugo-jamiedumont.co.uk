For those of you with an attention span decimated by social media, here’s the **TL;DR**:

# I. Build. Websites.

<hr />
In case that’s not enough for you, let me elaborate.

Today, I design and build websites, and occasionally iOS apps. I work for [Bikesoup](http://www.bikesoup.com) as their Lead Developer. I also work with a small number of private clients, and have some of my own projects to tinker with too!

I’m addicted to building - the medium doesn’t matter; but I am forever chasing the [Builder’s High](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/).

I believe that good things take time. Websites _(much like a business)_ should be built to be durable, sustainable and reliable. Anything else makes their creators/owners lives a misery.

## Today
These days, I live in Cornwall. I like balancing the long hours spent at the computer by going for a surf, or a cliff run, or just sitting on the beach with a beer.

Perhaps you'd like to work with me? If so, you can get in touch with me at <a href="mailto:jamiedumont@icloud.com">my email</a>.
