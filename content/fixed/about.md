I know, I know, you just want the **TL;DR** version of this page, so here it is...

# I. Build. Websites.

For those of you that are still here, <small>(congratulations by the way, your attention span is better than most!)</small> let me elaborate.

## "Do what you love!"

It's so cheesy and cliche to say that you love what you do, so I won't. Instead, I'll confess that I am 100%, fully addicted to whatever chemical concoction gets dumped into my brain as I build things. I've heard it referred to as the ["Builder's High"](), but whatever you choose to call it, I can't get enough of it.

This all started when I was a Graphic Designer. I enjoyed it, sure; but something was missing. I had neglected that when I was a kid, I was always pulling stuff apart or fiddling with it, just so that I could see how it worked. Many a pen, bicycle and TV remote got broken down into as many component parts as possible, the mechanics worked out, and then put back together. Unfortunately, not everything quite got to that last step - much to my parent's eternal frustration (sorry!).

That's what I had been missing with design. I was just pushing shapes around a page until they looked "right", and then sending my work off to the printers. I was missing out on all the action! I never got to see how things worked, how my designs came to life. More importantly, I wasn't a part of bringing them to life, so ended up being quite indifferent towards the results.

## A more practical solution
<small>Change this heading ^^^, it's crap!</small>

Fortunately, the solution to my design-woes was right in front of me the whole time. When I was really young, like 8 or 9, my uncle showed me a little of what he did for a living; software development. This is where I could profess that I took to it like a young prodigy and have been hacking away at a keyboard ever since; but as always, the reality is less glamorous. I got on well with it, I understood it and learned it, but I wasn't excited by it. Who can blame me, I was 9! I think the sum total of my efforts was a calculator written in Visual Basic, and a horrific looking website (but all websites were awful in the 90s weren't they?)
