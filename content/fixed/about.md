For those of you with an attention span decimated by social media, here’s the **TL;DR**:

# I. Build. Websites.

<hr />
In case that’s not enough for you, let me elaborate.

Today, I design and build websites, and occasionally iOS apps. I work for [Bikesoup](http://www.bikesoup.com) as their Lead Developer. I also work with a small number of private clients, and have some of my own projects to tinker with too!

I’m addicted to building - the medium doesn’t matter; but I am forever chasing the [Builder’s High](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/).

I believe that good things take time. Websites _(much like a business)_ should be built to be durable, sustainable and reliable. Anything else makes their creators/owners lives a misery.

## Backstory
Years ago, I found myself in London, having been a hopeless romantic and moved there on a whim to be with a girl I met. Unfortunately such idealism doesn’t put a roof over your head or beer tokens in your pocket, and the hard truth hit me…I had no clue how I wanted to do that.

I had been going through the red tape strewn process of applying to the military for 3 years, and had been keeping busy with temp work; alternated with far-flung, dangerous sounding adventures.

Meeting this girl (now my wife), and moving to London changed all that. I suddenly saw an alternative. I had always enjoyed tinkering with computers, and having been a Graphic Designer previously gave me the perfect springboard into a new career: web design.

Over time, and the course of a few jobs, web **design** became web **development** which became **software engineering**. All subtly different terms for what many would consider the same, but hidden in each are subtle nuances.

## Today
These days, I live in Cornwall. I like balancing the long hours spent at the computer by going for a surf, or a cliff run, or just sitting on the beach with a beer.
