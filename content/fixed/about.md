title: About

---


I design and build websites, using Elixir, Javascript and a lovely little CMS called Statamic. I'm CTO at [Bikesoup](http://www.bikesoup.com), and have undertaken a complete rebuild of their magazine and marketplace.

I believe that good things take time. Websites *(much like a business)* should be built to be durable, sustainable and reliable. Anything else makes their creators/owners lives a misery.

## Today

These days, I live in Cornwall. As much as I (sometimes) enjoyed London, I do better out in the fresh air. Too many hours sat at a keyboard isn't good for you, we all know that! I like balancing them by going for a surf, or a cliff run, or just sitting on the beach with a beer.

Perhaps you'd like to get in touch with me? If so, here's the [link!](mailto:jamiedumont@icloud.com).
