title: About

---


I design and build websites, using Elixir, Elm & Javascript. I work for [Bikesoup](http://www.bikesoup.com) as their Lead Developer. I also work with a small number of private clients, and have some of my own projects to tinker with too!

I believe that good things take time. Websites *(much like a business)* should be built to be durable, sustainable and reliable. Anything else makes their creators/owners lives a misery.

## Today

These days, I live in Cornwall. As much as I (sometimes) enjoyed London, I do better out in the fresh air. I like balancing the long hours spent at the computer by going for a surf, or a cliff run, or just sitting on the beach with a beer.

Perhaps you'd like to work with me? If so, you can get in touch with me at [my email](mailto:jamiedumont@icloud.com).
