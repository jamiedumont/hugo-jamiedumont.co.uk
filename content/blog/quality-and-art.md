When I was younger, and probably still to this day, a surefire way to exasperate my Father would be to tell him how much my new pair of jeans cost. The frustration was always borne of the fact that I probably couldn't afford much of what I bought, and that I never needed to spend as much money as I did; there was always a cheaper option that I rarely, if ever chose.

I'll get the disclaimer in early: I'm not going to opine about how you should handle your finances — that's 100% your business. Instead, I want to examine the "Why". What made me always choose to buy the best I could afford — even when it wasn't in my best interests to do so?

## "You get what you pay for"
This is a phrase that is often used to justify some gratuitous expenditure. I should know, I used this defence often enough: *"You don't understand Dad, these jeans will last much longer than the pair that cost £20"*.

What this suggests is that whenever we choose to buy the more expensive of two options, we consciously offset the cost of an item with it's expected lifetime or performance relative to the cheaper alternative. This sounds like logical, mature decision making at it's finest.

Unfortunately, just as I tried to justify my choice to my Dad, you are trying to justify to yourself why you should spend the money. The best way to silence our conscious minds is to give it something logical and tangible to chew on. Mentally amortising the cost makes us feel better about a decision that could quite likely create a great deal of "buyers-remorse" if not logical explained.

What I ignored when defending my choice was **my** reality (I'd probably fall off my bike, or wipe oil on these jeans, long before they wore out, completely negating the "lifespan" argument) and the realities of our modern manufacturing.

The reality is that you probably have a deeper, unconscious desire for whatever it is you're about to buy; but we'll get to that shortly. In our modern, global world of mass production and marketing, it's unlikely that what you're about to buy is substantially better than the cheaper alternative.

Put bluntly, when looking to increase sales, a business will choose to increase or improve marketing efforts, rather than improve the product or service. This is because improving what's on offer is likely to be expensive, time-consuming and require substantial change to infrastructure (manufacturing methods, materials, distribution, etc). It's far easier to create a compelling story for why you should buy this product over another.

Take the example of my jeans. The more expensive pair probably shares many commonalities with the cheaper. They might be made using the same techniques, they may share similar materials, or they could even be the exact same item, just with a different label on them!

It's far easier and more effective for a business to "Sell a better product" than it is to "make a better product".

Mass produced, perceived lower quality, even though it's likely to be higher.

## Belonging

This is the more inflammatory and perhaps negative of the two drivers. Humans have always felt a need to "belong" thanks to our tribal mentality. During our formative years as a species, you needed to fit in with the tribe, because you relied on each other for survival. To be rejected and outcast was to risk death.

We live in more civilised times, where buying the wrong pair of jeans isn't going to dramatically shorten your lifespan. However, our need to belong is just as strong as it ever was. Of course, thousands of years of evolution can't be undone in a few generations; but I'm going to be cynical and suggest that we need a sense of belonging now more than we ever have. Social media, blah blah.

## Connection

Instead, perhaps what we want is connection to the person that made it? Art, fine engineering.

Own them because we get an inisght into how someone was thinking. The physical items become artifacts of their thought process, and with examination, tell us more about their creator than if they were stood in front of us.
