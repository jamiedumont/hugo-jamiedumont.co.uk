Seth Godin always manages to pack a punch with every article he writes. They are never long, rarely complex and more often than not, don't tell us anything new. However, they are like a surgeon's blade, cutting right into the belly of a discussion and laying bare everything that we would rather ignore.

His recent article, [The Candy Diet](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/01/the-candy-diet.html) had me nodding my head, but also angrily shaking my head.

> The economics seem to be that the only way to make a living is to reach a lot of people and the only way to reach a lot of people is to race to the bottom, seek out quick clicks, make it easy to swallow, reinforce existing beliefs, keep it short, make it sort of fun, or prurient, or urgent, and most of all, dumb it down.

Excuse my language, but _f**k_ that! F**k it right to the core!

Unfortunately I have to agree, but I'm stating now that I want no part in it. If you, the readers, ever catch me trying to pull the sort of crap that Seth highlights here; then call me out on it! I don't want to contribute to our increasingly toxic culture
