* Single-purposed work flow

* Better for remote development - better over unstable connection

My history with laptops was always a bit fraught. They've either been really unreliable (2008 MacBook Pro 17") or underpowered (2010 MacBook Air 11"). I think it would be fair to say that I've always completed my work *despite* my equipment - the small screen size of the MBA being particularly awkward. 

That all changed when Bikesoup supplied me with a 2015 MacBook Pro. For the first time in a long while I had a computer that was so incredibly capable and comfortable to use. The 15" Retina screen was a God-send after the Air!

However, I started to develop this really irrational itch for an iPad. Now, I've never owned an iPad - I guess I just never felt the need for one - but the thought of being able to do __all__ my work on an iPad became an obsession.

After I saw [Mark's article](http://yieldthought.com/post/31857050698/ipad-linode-1-year-later) about how his experiment of developing on an iPad became a fulltime thing, I was hooked. The only issue was that I was deeply wedded to my OS X tools, and was doing far more frontend work that made a good set of browser developer tools almost mandatory.
