I just posted a [quick run-down of the software that I use](/uses) on a near
daily basis. In time I'll add the hardware and services that I use and
recommend too, and try to keep the list as up to date as possible!

This post was inspired by — and very similar to — [Harry Robert's
list.](https://csswizardry.com/uses/)
