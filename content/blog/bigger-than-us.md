title: A world that's bigger than us
---

Can you remember it? It wasn't long ago, but seems much further. That time when the world was small, manageable and knowable. I'm guessing many of my readers won't, they are simply too young.

I remember when mobile phones were new, and were used only to tell your Mum that you'd missed the school bus, but only if you had enough pay-as-you-go credit. I remember that wonderful sound when my Gateway running Windows 95 dialled up, and the internet opened out (slowly) before me.

These were all "big" things, and they promised unbounded opportunities. We were about to make the world a whole lot smaller. Suddenly, true global communication seemed at hand. I could email, or even chat in realtime on "MSN Live" with my relatives on the other side of the world - all for the cost of my internet connection.

## "Big" got bigger

I remember when my Dad finally decided to opt for broadband, even though it was extortionate back then! We could be connected to the internet 24 hours a day, with so much more speed on tap - it was incredible. Emails arrived not when you checked them, but when they were sent. Any any answer to any question was just seconds away now that Google had started to do it's thing. What a time to be growing up and learning about the world!

All this promised to make the world smaller, closer and more immediate. It delivered on that in spades, but so much so that we've shot out the other side, and entered a world so impossibly big, we can't even comprehend it.

With the advent of mobile data, smart phones and social networks, we've created a system that is so large, it's impossible to see the edges anymore. Everyone is publishing online these days, either on their own blog, their Facebook account, tweeting sound bites throughout the day or sharing their creativity through platforms like Instagram, Vimeo and whatever else has launched whilst I'm writing this.

Everyone probably has at least two social media accounts, certainly one; and I'm guessing many have a whole lot more! All of their friends, family, colleagues and "professional network" are publishing non-stop, 24/7. The result is a complete avalanche of information.

We're all getting buried under a constant stream of information, far more than we can manage. Think about that person with 3000 "friends" on Facebook, think about the celebrity with over a million followers... It's totally inhuman.

No, I don't mean inhumane, I mean inhuman. Think about it, how can a particularly bright chimpanzee - which is all that we are - comprehend a group of people that large? The answer is that we can't.

I challenge anyone with more than 100 friends on Facebook to tell me something real about all of them. Not something in their profile, but something real; something a friend would know.

You can't. I know you can't. Instead of depth, of knowing a few people but truly knowing them, we've opted for breadth. We skim the surface of other people's lives, but never really *know* them.

What's more worrying, is many skim the surface of their own lives too. They get lost in the cascade of information, caught up in the micro moments of others, and never really find the time to spend with themselves.

We're social creatures by nature, that's how we've survived and got here. But our instinct to gather groups around us is our undoing at present. We're amassing social groups that instead of protecting us, are overwhelming and insulating us from the real world. We've created this big world above us, that lives only in ones and zeros, and it's blinded us to the real, physical world that we actually inhabit.

## Insidious

Many will cry "What's the harm? I can handle it!". Many will say that their networks are crucial to their everyday lives, and that the "connectedness" enriches their day. I'd argue that you're so far down the rabbit hole that you can't see the damage that you're doing.

Of course this is an issue across every walk of life in the Western world, but I see it most clearly in my peers; developers. To tar us all with one brush is obviously wrong, but for the most part we're likely to be a little more restrained than everyone else. We're more likely to be introverts, happier with our own company. All this social network stuff, live-streaming whatever it is that you live-stream, constantly firing out photos and feelings into the ether; it's all quite alien to us anyway.

However, that hasn't stopped us. We gather in forums, form communities around our technologies, start open-source groups to create something new, we blog, we tweet, we take on speaking gigs. Everything about progressing in our careers is about getting your name, your thoughts and your work out there for the world to see. We're bigger social media junkies than most - constantly connected, always having to edge just that little bit closer to the magical "thought-leader" status.

Open source is the hub around which all of this spins. The projects we start only to perhaps share our solution with someone else start to gather speed and mass, until they become a runaway freight train loaded with GitHub stars. The problem is that suddenly one developer that happened on a better way of doing something is suddenly burdened with the collective weight of an industry.

If you're a developer who's built a tool to help yourself, and others, build something; you're good at what you do. Being able to craft your own tools is a skill and something I think we share with only a handful of other professions these days. To have your tool, approved and adopted by other developers is a mark of great respect.

However, due to the immediate and dare I say it - self-centred world that we live in, the entrance fee of deference and respect seems to get forgotten. Much has been written lately about the problems of open source, largely centered on it's user's attitudes, but it all can be summed up by

>"This library doesn't suit my use-case 100%, it is therefore broken. Please change it to suit my needs".

Developers using other people's tools seemed to have this odd sense of entitlement. Not only is it dangerous for these developers to rely on others work instead of understanding the problem fully and working towards their own solution, it's incredibly damaging to Open Source at large.

Open source opens an individual developer up to a world so large
