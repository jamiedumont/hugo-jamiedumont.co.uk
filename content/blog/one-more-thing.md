"Focus" is something that as developers, we get very good at. Unfortunately, in our modern world, we don't get the time we really need to properly commit to long uninterrupted sessions of work. Maybe that's why so many of us are night owls? Necessity dictates that we find coping mechanisms, just to deliver and meet our deadlines.

We get very good at getting our head down, shutting the world out and giving everything we've got to the project at hand for as many uninterrupted minutes as we've been gifted.

The problem with this ability however, is that we get too good at shutting the world out. It becomes really easy to ignore what's going on around us, and all of the other things that deserve our attention too. Our families, friends, hobbies, commitments and health can all become secondary and fall prey to *"more urgent"* matters.

Over time of course, all of these can become urgent, but by then, it's often much too late. It's unlikely your better half will calmly point out your behaviour *before* it upsets them. It's unlikely that you'll notice your deteriorating health and growing waistline until damage has been done that's hard to undo.

## How do we fix this?

You're probably expecting me to wax lyrical about the importance of balance and moderation. How everything in the correct dose will leave you with a life at a comfortable equilibrium, where both work and play get a healthy, appropriate amount of your time.

Instead I'm going to prescribe the cause of the issue as the cure. **Focus on one thing - and only one thing - intently.**

I've tried to juggle all these responsibilities before, and I've always inevitably failed. Often I try to tackle too much, and either burn out, or get frustrated at my lack of results.

If you're trying to be a better partner/father/mother/friend whilst trying to get fit, eat right, engage in hobbies and try to excel in our profession; you're almost certainly doomed to failure. You'll either spread yourself so thin you fail to see any measurable results, or you'll burn out before you do.

**Instead, I've started giving everything I've got to one goal, and only one.**

The trick is working out which goal *(hint: it probably isn't work)*. Unfortunately, there's no set formula for finding that one commitment, or anybody that can just tell you what it is. It requires a bit of introspection and experimentation.

Instead of focussing on what you have to do, or even what you want to accomplish; work out what makes you feel great about yourself.

It could be 30 minutes quiet meditation or journalling each day, or it could be cooking every evening. Whatever it is, it should make you feel like you're accomplishing something of real value.

My "feel-good" commitment is CrossFit. I really enjoy the hard workouts, the community, and the feeling of accomplishing something that at the outset seems impossible. It's rare for me to leave a session demoralised and not surfing an incredible wave of endorphins.

Now that might sound intimidating, but it's just my jam. Your's might be a leisurely swim before work, a walk on a Sunday morning, a Friday evening margarita, a meditation session at lunch or reading every evening.

Your commitment can be exciting, relaxing, intense or just plain fun. It can be hourly, daily or weekly. It can be anything, as long as it makes you feel great about yourself.

Once you know what it is, pour every ounce of energy you have into keeping that commitment.

## The Results

That post-workout "feel-good" factor is what keeps me coming back for more. Because I enjoy it, I manage to go 4-5 times a week without it feeling like a chore.

Now, this is where it gets clever. The "feel-good" factor leaves me much better prepared and more likely to deal with everything going on in my life. I'm far more social, positive, patient and relaxed. When I sit down to work, I'm more productive. When I make decisions about what to eat, I will tend towards the healthier option.

If I can keep this one commitment, then...

* My diet naturally cleans up - I don't want to undo all that hard earned sweat.

* My sleep cycle evens out and I get more rest.

* I'm much more easy-going.

* I find far more hours in my day - somehow - and am far more productive.

* I'm overall more relaxed and content with life. I can focus on one task at a time, and give it my all.

When I miss my sessions...

* I start snacking, and the type of food gets progressively worse the longer I'm not exercising.

* I stay up late, either because I haven't got to be up for an early morning workout, or I haven't just finished an evening class that's completely worn me out. Instead, I end up permanently tired.

* I get cranky, really cranky. I have next to zero patience - and I'll admit it - I'm a complete arsehole if I'm stressed!

* I'm a waste of space. I revert to mindless procrastination instead of meaningful work.

* I'm agitated, restless and frustrated with where I currently am. My attention is fragmented and I rarely achieve anything - certainly nothing of value.

## One Thing

I've found that by focussing on just one thing; I don't really have to think about the rest. I don't need to use my finite amount of willpower to tackle every area of my life.

Give it a try. Think about what makes you feel really good about yourself, and start prioritising it. I think you'll be pleased with the cascade of side-effects!
