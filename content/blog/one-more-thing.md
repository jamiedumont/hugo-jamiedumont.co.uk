"Focus" is something that as developers, we get very good at. Unfortunately, in our modern world, we don't get the time we really need to properly commit to long uninterrupted sessions of work. Necessity dictates that we find coping mechanisms, just to deliver and meet our deadlines. 

We get very good at getting our head down, shutting the world out and giving everything we've got to the projects at hand; for as many uninterrupted minutes as we've been gifted.

The problem with this ability however is that we get too good at shutting the world out. It becomes really easy to ignore what's going on around us. Our families, friends, hobbies, commitments and health can all become secondary and fall prey to *"more urgent"* matters.

Over time of course, all of these issues can become urgent, but by then, it's often much too late. It's unlikely your better half will calmly point out your behaviour *before* it becomes an issue. It's unlikely that you'll notice your deteriorating health until some real damage has been done. Life has a way of slipping by unnoticed, and before you know it, glacial changes have added up to a dramatic change in the landscape.

## How do we fix this?

You're probably expecting me to wax lyrical about the importance of balance and moderation. How everything in the correct dose will leave you with a life at a comfortable equilibrium.

Instead I'm going to prescribe the cause of the issue as the cure. **Focus on something, intently.**

We all try to juggle these responsibilities, and inevitably fail. Often we try to tackle too much, and either burn out, or get frustrated at our lack of results. 

If you're trying to be a better partner/father/mother/friend whilst trying to get fit, eat right, engage in hobbies and try to excel in our profession; you're doomed to failure. You'll either spread yourself so thin you fail to see any measurable results, or you'll burn out before you do.

**Instead, give everything you've got to one goal, and only one.Â **

The trick is working out which goal *(hint: it probably isn't work)*. Unfortunately, there's no set formula for finding that one commitment, or anybody that can just tell you what it is. It requires a bit of introspection and experimentation. 

Work out what makes you feel great about yourself. It could be 30 minutes quiet meditation, journalling, cooking every evening, anything! Whatever it is, it should be something that you commit to - without fail!

Mine for example is exercise, but not just any exercise. My commitment is brutally hard, punishing exercise; as often as I can muster it. Now because I'm not superhuman, that only means 5-6 times a week.

Now that might sound intimidating, but it's just my jam. Your's might be a leisurely swim, a walk on a Sunday morning, a Friday evening margarita, a meditation session at lunch or reading every evening.

Your commitment can be exciting, relaxing, punishing or just fun. It can be hourly, daily or weekly (less often than that makes it less impactful). It can be anything, as long as it makes you feel great about yourself.

Once you know what it is, pour every ounce of energy you have into keeping that commitment.

## The Results

For me, it's a hard sweat, aching muscles and the dread of the next gym session. It's funny, but I genuinely don't look forward to my Crossfit sessions. I always think about taking today off, or try to bargain with myself. But, I'm addicted to the rewards it offers, and the feeling I get once it's done; so I keep going.

If I can keep this one commitment, then...
* My diet naturally cleans up.
* My sleep cycle evens out and I get more rest.
* I have far more patience for both family, friends and colleagues.
* I find far more hours in my day - somehow - and am far more productive.
* I'm overall more relaxed and content with life. I can focus on one task at a time, and give it my all.

When I miss my sessions...
* I start snacking, and the type of food gets progressively worse the longer I'm not exercising.
* I stay up late, either because I haven't got to be up for an early morning session, or I haven't just finished an evening class that's completely worn me out. I end up permanently tired.
* I get cranky, really cranky. I have next to zero patience - and I'll admit it - I'm a complete arsehole!
* I'm a waste of space. I revert to mindless procrastination instead of meaningful work.
* I'm agitated, restless and frustrated with where I currently am. My attention is fragmented and I rarely achieve anything - certainly nothing of value.

## One Thing
So, you can see, by focussing on just one thing; I don't really have to think about the rest. I don't need to use my finite amount of willpower to tackle every area of my life.

Getting one part of my life squared away seems to cascade into all of the others.
