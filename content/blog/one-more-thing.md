"Focus" is something that as developers, we get very good at. Unfortunately, in our modern world, we don't get the time we really need to properly commit to Deep Work, but necessity dictates that we find coping mechanisms, just to deliver. We get very good at getting our head down, shutting the world out and giving everything we've got to the projects at hand; for as many uninterrupted minutes as we've been gifted.

The problem with this ability however is that we get too good at shutting the world out. It becomes really easy to ignore what's going on around us. Our spouses, families, hobbies, commitments and health can all become secondary and fall prey to "more urgent" matters.

Over time of course, all of this issues can become urgent, but by then, it's often much too late. It's unlikely your better half will calmly point out your behaviour *before* it becomes an issue. It's unlikely that you'll notice your deteriorating health until some real damage has been done. Life has a way of slipping by unoticed, and before you know it, glacial changes have added up to a dramatic change in the landscape.

## How do we fix this?

You're probably expecting me to wax lyrical about the importance of balance and moderation. How everything in the correct dose will leave you with a life at a comfortable equilibrium.

Instead I'm going to prescribe the cause of the issue as the cure. Focus on something, intently.

We all try to juggle these responsibilities, and enevitably fail. Often we try to tackle too much, and either burn out, or get frustrated at our lack of results. If you're trying to be a better partner/father/mother/friend whilst trying to get fit, eat right, engage in hobbies and try to excel in our profession; you're doomed to fail. You'll either spread yourself so thin you fail to see any measurable results, or you'll burn out before you do.

Instead, give everything you've got to one goal, and only one. The trick is working out which goal. Unfortunately, there's no set formula for finding that one commitment, or anyone that can tell you what it is. It requires a bit of introspection and experimentation. These can look remarkably like trying everything at once, but with a conscitouis effort will remain focussed.

Mine for example is exercise, but not just any exercise. My cornerstone commitment is brutally hard, punishing exercise; as often as I can muster it, usually 5-6 times a week. Now that might sound intimidating, but it's just my jam. Your's might be a leisurely swim, a walk on a Sunday morning, a Friday evening margarita, a meditation session at lunch. Your cornerstone commitment can be exciting, relaxing, punishing or just fun. It can be hourly, daily or weekly (less often than that makes it less impactful). It can be anything! For me, it's a hard sweat, aching muscles and the dread of the next session. It's funny, I genuinely don't look forward to my Crossfit sessions, but I'm addicted to the rewards it offers.

If I can make it work, then...

*   <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"></span>My diet naturally cleans up
*   My sleep cycle evens out and I get more rest
*   I have far more patience for both family, friends and colleagues
*   I find far more hours in my day - somehow - and am far more productive
*   I'm overall more relaxed and content with life

<div>When I miss my sessions...</div>

<div>

*   <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"></span> I start snacking, and the type of food gets progressively worse
*   I stay up late, either because I haven't got an early morning session, or I haven't just finished an evening class
*   <span style="-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"></span> I get cranky, really cranky. Trust me, you'll know if I haven't been!
*   I'm a waste of space. I revert to mindless procrastination.
*   I'm agitated, restless and frustrated with where I currently am.
