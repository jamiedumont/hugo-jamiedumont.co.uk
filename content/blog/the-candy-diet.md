Seth Godin always manages to pack a punch with every article he writes, if you haven't read any of his writing then I suggest you start now! His articles are never long, rarely complex and more often than not tell us what we already quite aware of. However, they are like a surgeon's blade, cutting right into the belly of a discussion and making clear the uncomfortable facts that we'd rather ignore.

His recent article, [The Candy Diet](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/01/the-candy-diet.html) had me nodding my head, but also putting in my palms in despair.

> The economics seem to be that the only way to make a living is to reach a lot of people and the only way to reach a lot of people is to race to the bottom, seek out quick clicks, make it easy to swallow, reinforce existing beliefs, keep it short, make it sort of fun, or prurient, or urgent, and most of all, dumb it down.

I'll state right here, right now, that I want no part in this future.
