I'm leaving Bikesoup, where I've spent the last two years as Lead Developer. It's been a roller coaster ride, what startup isn't after all? When I think back on everything that I accomplished with the Bikesoup team, and everything that I _didn't_ know before I joined them, it's clear just how much I've grown during my time there. 

Much of what I've learnt has been the hard way, from making mistakes, and recognising with hindsight what I should have done instead. It can be a harsh and at times demoralising way to learn, but I'll always be grateful to Bikesoup for giving me the opportunity to work and learn this way — I don't think it's an understatement to say that many of these lessons will stay with me for the rest of my career. So, to my team at Bikesoup, a profound *"Thank-you"!*

All that said, I've decided **it's time to go it alone.**

I've got some of my own projects that I want to dedicate a proper amount of time to explore thoroughly. It's always said that you should scratch your own itches with side-projects, and that's what these will do. I've noticed some things in a few areas of a few industries that could be *much* better!

I want to be very public and open about these projects — both the good times, and the bad — because I now know that startups never just appear fully formed, ready to go. There's a real sense of survivorship bias when it comes to developers starting their own ventures, and I think that it gives a lot of other developers an unrealistic view of what's needed to build something for yourself. I want to share my progress, warts and all, so that others might avoid some of the mistakes I'll no doubt make along the way.

I'm also really excited to work with new people on their projects. Whenever I've looked up from my own work, there's so many cool ideas being explored by people just as passionate about building something great as I am. I really want to work with these people, those that have got the bit between their teeth and are hell-bent on producing something awesome they can proudly put their name on. These are the people I want to work with!

I am going to become available in October so – regardless of your location, budget, requirements or whatever – if you think we could work together then [let me know](mailto:jamiedumont@icloud.com). We’ll see what we can work out.

I think the people I can help _most_ of all are those that have the skills to get started, but perhaps not fully execute their idea because of some of the technical details. Think designers and front-end developers that need a backend or API for their project. If you're a startup that wants to grow, but are worried about how your tech will keep up — I can help with that. If you've got a web app that's starting to get a bit tangled — I want to help you _untangle_ it.

Whatever your requirements, budget or location I'd be really interested to speak with you and see how I can help. From consulting, to hands-on dev work, to writing and even *- gulp! -* to speaking; I want to start working on a wide variety of things for a wide variety of awesome people!

So... [	want to get talking and see how I can help?](mailto:jamiedumont@icloud.com)
