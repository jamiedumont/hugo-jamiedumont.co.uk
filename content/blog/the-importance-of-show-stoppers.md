Building a business is difficult, and building a website isn’t much easier. With both there are always a hundred different tasks or opportunities screaming out to take priority. It's easy (and impossible) to make **everything** is a priority, and I've always got poor results from trying to tackle everything at once.

Instead, I’ve come to realise that I can cut right through the noise, by looking for the “show-stoppers”.

## What are they?

"Show-stoppers" are those events or issues that just make absolutely everything grind to a halt . When you run into one of these, your whole plan comes crashing down on top of you, and everyone jumps to panic stations. I've been on the receiving end of a few - and trust me when I say - your heart just sinks when you realise you've been bitten by one.

For example, if you were a startup a show-stopper can be something as simple (but fundamental) as the money running out before you’ve worked out how to make a profit. There’s no coming back from that really...

In web development terms, we’re talking about the catastrophic crashes. These are when your app locks up because of a blocked process, or a string of servers all start crashing like a row of dominos.

I've even thought about my gym workouts this way. Anyone who’s done Crossfit will know how hard overhead-squats can be. I personally, really struggle with them. They are my show-stoppers. If they show up in a workout, I can pretty much write off any chance of posting a good time.

## Avoiding them

I've found that the key to spending your time well is to focus on how you can prevent or reduce the impact of these show-stoppers.

For our example startup, they should concentrate on making their own money before they spend all their investors money. That means focussing on the fundamentals like delivering a solid product to market that people will pay for. No amount of expensive advertising, exciting brand partnerships or knock-out round of investment will make up for a product that simply doesn’t work (or possibly isn't even needed).

Fortunately the web is [built on really solid foundations](https://resilientwebdesign.com) that help us developers out - yet we seem to ignore them all too often. Declarative languages (HTML & CSS) should be used wherever possible (in place of JS). If content can be rendered on the server - or not at all by [using a static site](https://www.netlify.com/case-studies/smashing/) - do it! Reduce the number of unknown variables needed for a successful outcome.

If an error does occur, try to prompt the user on how to fix the issue, or if they can’t - how best to report it to someone that can. Prevention and mitigation.

The solution to my CrossFit workouts? I'd love to write overhead squats off as just something that I'm not good at. Instead, as much as I'll hate it, [I could work at them until they got easier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVULA-q1a9M) and I felt confident when they showed up in workouts.

## It comes down to time

Everyone in this world gets given the same number of hours and minutes to work with each day. The people and businesses that are killing it at the top of their field are those that are spending their time wisely. Finding your “show-stoppers” will help you spend your time more effectively.
