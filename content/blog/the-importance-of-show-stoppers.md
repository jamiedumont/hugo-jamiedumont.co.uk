Building a business is difficult, and building a website isn’t much easier. With both there are always a hundred different tasks or opportunities screaming out to take priority. The problem comes when **everything** is a priority. You end up reactive, and your best made plans can go right out the window.

Over time, I’ve come to realise that a particular thought process can cut right through the noise, and can quickly show what you should be doing — I look for the “show-stoppers”.

## What are they?

Show-stoppers come in many guises, but this thinking can be applied to pretty much any situation. Look for the events or issues that will stop absolutely everything. When you run into one of these, everything comes crashing down on top of you, and everyone jumps to panic stations. These are the show-stoppers.

If you were a startup, an example of one would be something as simple as the money running out before you’ve worked out how to make a profit…there’s no coming back from that really.

In web development terms, we’re talking about the catastrophic crashes. For front-end developers that probably means the Javascript error that locks up the entire interface and requires a browser refresh to get the app working again.

I could even think about my gym workouts this way. Anyone who’s done Crossfit will know how hard overhead-squats can be. I personally, really struggle with them. They are my show-stoppers. If they show up in a workout, I can pretty much write off any chance of posting a good time.

## Avoiding them

The key to spending your time well is to focus on what will prevent or reduce the impact of these show-stoppers.

For our startup, they should concentrate on making their own money before they spend all their investors money. That means focussing on the fundamentals like delivering a solid product to market that people will pay for. No amount of expensive advertising will make up for a product that simply doesn’t work (or possibly isn't even needed).

Front-end developers need to develop in a way that a JS error is less-likely to occur in the first place. Techniques like [“cutting the mustard”](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/18948466399/cutting-the-mustard) can help here. If an error does occur, try to prompt the user on how to fix the issue, or if they can’t - how best to report it to someone that can. Prevention and mitigation.

The solution to my CrossFit workouts? It would be really easy to write overhead squats off as just something that I'm not good at. Instead I could work at them until they came easily and I felt really confident when they showed up in workouts.

## It comes down to time

Everyone in this world gets given the same number of hours and minutes to work with each day. The people and businesses that are killing it at the top of their field are those that are spending their time wisely. Finding your “show-stoppers” will help you spend your time more effectively.
