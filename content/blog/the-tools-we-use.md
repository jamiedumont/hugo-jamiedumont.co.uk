## The Work Laptop

I can't think of any other device that's as synonymous with "Web Development" as the MacBook Pro. For years, they've been issued out to legions of developers, and have become the de facto device for anyone, beginner or seasoned-pro, who wants to build software.

However, I think that title is starting to fall into question. Don't get me wrong, I still use my 2015 MacBook Pro for nearly all my "work", but I've recently been using my iPad Pro (12.9") for my side projects.
<p class="">I use <a href="http://www.blink.sh">Blink</a>&nbsp;to SSH (or mosh) into a remote server -&nbsp;<i>more on this setup another time -</i>&nbsp;and hack away at these projects as if I was on my MacBook. There is absolutely no reason I couldn't use this setup for 100% of my work.</p>

So, when my fellow developer at Bikesoup asked my advice this morning about which new EmojiBar Pro (MBP) to get, I didn't get that same sense of lust that I normally do around new tech. It's partly because I'm very satisfied with my 2015 MBP, but mainly because I'm completely non-fussed with the latest update.

## "Professional" backlash

Apple has been on the receiving end of quite a bit abuse from their "professional users" the last few years - which isn't really unexpected. The new MacBook Pro was a bit of a let down for many. I think they were hoping for something with a bit more poke (and a bit less pricey) after such a long wait. They certainly expected more innovation than an upgrade to lots of Thunderbolt 3 ports and touchscreen equivalent of their function keys. Users of the Mac Pro or Mac Mini have been waiting an age for a meaningful update, and even the iMac was starting to look a little neglected.

Couple that with the "Pro" moniker making it's way to iPads, which for many will never be a "Pro" device, no matter how capable; and the "professional users" were starting to feeling like Apple had abandoned them.

Apple's neglect is understandable to a degree. We represent a very costly sector from an R&D standpoint, with very limited scope for profit. To be clear, we're still worth billions to a company like Apple, but are a minority compared to the consumer market buying iPhones every year.

## A new direction

I'll confess, Apple's recent trajectory has had me looking around at other options. I'm a Mac-user, but not a Mac-fan with their current lineup. I'd happily build myself a computer and work on Linux (or even Windows 10) if they continued with the trend of high-ticket computers that can't be upgraded.

Apple have been very clear on touchscreen Macs thus far, which I think is the right call. As nice as computers like the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzMLA8YIgG0">Microsoft Surface Studio</a> look, I suspect in day-to-day use there would be too many compromises.

Instead, they are very clearly pushing for iPads and similar devices to "grow-up" and become most people's only computer, a job that they are already very capable of. As I've already said, as a professional, working developer I'd happily use my iPad Pro for everything I do; save for perhaps design - ironically.

However, most will never go "full iPad", always keeping a Mac around; and that makes sense. As capable as an iPad is, it will always be a mobile device, and not afford the same efficiencies as a more purposeful, dedicated work computer. However, what doesn't make sense is to have an iPad Pro and a MBP in your arsenal - they are just too similar.

Instead, what if you had an iPad Pro and a kick arse desktop setup? Having a monstrously powerful desktop, with multiple large displays is almost certainly a preferable working environment to any 15" laptop, no matter how easy it is to hook into external monitors and the such like.

Thankfully, Apple seems to be thinking this way too. They recently announced that there will be iMac updates this year, and thatÂ 
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives">a complete rethink of the Mac Pro is in the works</a>. They admit that they engineered themselves into a corner with the recent design, and that instead they will be pursuing a highly modular, upgradable computer, with accompanying displays like the good ol' days. The Mac Mini might even survive, although Apple are being tight lipped on that one.

I love how enthusiastic their quotes come across. It sounds like there is a real energy behind the Mac once more, and it's not just languishing in the dark corners of Apple HQ waiting to be put down like many people feared.

I personally can't wait to sink my teeth in a big desktop again. Whether that's an iMac later this year, or a Mac Pro in a couple; I'm not sure. What I do know is that having a dedicated workstation, coupled with my highly mobile iPad is about as close to perfect as I'm likely to get.
