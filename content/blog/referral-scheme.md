I've got this theory that the status-quo of "Marketing" (with a capital "M"!) in this digital world we've built is all a load of bullshit. I could rant about how we've decided all Marketing involves handing over big sums of cash to people like Google and Facebook; but I won't having only just put away my tin-foil hat from my [last article] on Google Analytics.

Instead of pulling all the usual tricks that a consultant with a fancy-sounding title would advise me to do (write a free eBook, start a newsletter, build an audience on Facebook), I'm going to keep my "marketing strategy" simple. If you're reading this, you probably know what I'm all about, and the sort of services I offer.

Therefore, if there's someone you think that I could help, let them know! Send them my way! As a thank you for the referral you'll get the choice of either a Â£50 Amazon voucher, or (assuming we know each other, and aren't on opposite sides of the planet) a swanky dinner on me!

I'd rather give a little "Thank-you" to those that know me, or have worked with me before, than trawling the internet looking for clients. The truth of the matter is that word-of-mouth referrals are the best kind, and I'd love to build a network of like-minded people who can all help one another.
