    Hey, I'm <a class="link fw5"href="/about">Jamie</a> and I work as a freelance developer
  </p>
  <p class="fw1 measure mb5">
    I primarily work with Elixir, and it's wonderful framework Phoenix to build web apps and APIs. On the frontend I'm an avid user of functional/atomic CSS, and use Javascript sparingly. That said, I have a wealth of experience building single page, and isomorphic applications using React, Vue and more recently with Elm.
